# What is the Internet and how it came to be

The Internet is essentially a network built to connect computers and other capable devices. It provides an easy way of sharing information that was previously only accessible on one single device at one location across multiple devices around the world. 

The invention of the Internet we are using today was a collective effort made among many people and parties in several countries. The original concept of the Internet goes back to ARPANET, the communications system designed by the US government to survive a nuclear attack, and packet switching, the idea that data can be divided into packets and transmitted over ARPANET. The first application of ARPANET was to connect the computers at four universities in the US to share their computing power. From there, ARPANET quickly expanded to the entire US in the following two years. After that, Trasfer Control Protocal/Internet Protocal (TCP/IP) was created to standardize and eliminate the different methods of packet switching invented in the UK, Norway and France. Today, we are still using the very same but updated version of TCP/IP to access the Internet.
