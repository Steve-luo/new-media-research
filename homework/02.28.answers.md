### Idea No.12: Bulletin Board Systems

*In the early days of the Internet, different communities from gamers to artists to journalists to fans of various things started their own BBSs. What are some examples of early BBSs that aren't mentioned in the book. Support your answer with sources. (extra props if you can find a BBS that is still active and you can figure out how to visit it!)*

* One of the most famous BBS'es in the 1980s was the Exec-PC BBS, launched on November 28, 1983 in the den of owner Bob Mahoney. Exec-PC BBS was known primarily for its extensive shareware software archives, and it also offered E-mail, message forums, and BBS door games to paying subscribers.<sup>[[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExecPC_BBS)</sup> 

* Although BBS was invented a long time ago, there are still a large number of enthusiasts that are actively developing new BBS'es and publishing posts.

### Idea No.36: GeoCities

*The book mentions that Yahoo! purchased GeoCities and that, because they were loosing money on it, Yahoo! would eventually announce that they would be shutting it down. However, it did not mention the fact that this annoucement was made only a few months before the shut down. Yahoo! would be deleting all the data on the GeoCities servers, this meant thousands of early user generated websites would disappear from the Internet forever. Fortunately, some folks found those websites to be important and valuable pieces of Internet history and took action to try and preserve some of these sites. Who are these people? What did they do to save GeoCities? Support your answer with sources.*

* Shortly after the GeoCities closing announcement, the Internet Archive announced a project to archive GeoCities pages, stating "GeoCities has been an important outlet for personal expression on the Web for almost 15 years." Internet Archive made it their task to ensure the thoroughness and completeness of their archive of GeoCities sites.<sup>[[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) [[Internet Archive]](https://archive.org/web/geocities.php)</sup> 

* Besides Internet Archive, many other groups of people also contributed their efforts to preserving GeoCities's data, like Geociti.es, WebCite, and ReoCities, which are not longer running; [GEOCITIES.ws](http://www.geocities.ws/archive/) and [OoCities](http://www.oocities.org/) that still offer archived pages besides Internet Archive.
