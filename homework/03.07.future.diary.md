Today is my 28th birthday. Apart from all the wishes and gifts I received from my families and friends, I also received a mysterious package from Amazon. It was an old-school vinyl player I’ve had my eyes on for quite some time but hesitated to place an order. They managed to get a heavy discount based on my credit score. All I needed to do was to tap a button on my phone and pay the bill. When I signed up for this service I did not expect it to work so well. Now that I’ve seen it in action, it might be a pretty sweet function to keep on.

I lost my job today. I’ve been a professional driver for 40 years now, and I was let go because my boss got a new car that doesn’t need a driver at all. All they do now is tap a button on their phones and their cars will just drive around the city to pick them up. I guess I’ll have to find a job in some other fields, but not many jobs are available now. Low level labor is filled by robots, and those tech companies would never hire someone like me. What should I do now…
