* Description: Screenshot of my research notes and source manager. 

I utilized markdown as the main format for my research notes and EndNote as a manager for all the sources I collected. With the additional help of git and Github.com, I can keep track of my research progress and backup every changes I made online. By documenting this process using a screenshot can best show my process of research for the technology of machine learning. The correlation between the notes and sources, and between the research methodology and my topic are clearly shown.
