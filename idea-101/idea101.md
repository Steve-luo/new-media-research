# Machine Learning

When computers were first created, they were only a tool to help human with complex math problems. With the development of this particular technology over the past decades, computers are capable of many more things. However, computers still require a human operator (a.k.a a developer) to put instructions (a.k.a program) into them in order to function. Now, with the concept of machine learning, computers finally have the ability to learn and improve themselves all on their own. 

Machine learning utilizes a special type of algorithm that allows the computers to perform a specific task without explicit instructions to rely on patterns and inference instead of human interventions. The developers no longer need to code step-by-step programs. They only need to "teach" the computers how to complete certain tasks, and the computers would "figure out" the way to do it, shifting the concentration from programming to writing algorithms, the code to "teach" a computer. 

The first achievement of the concept of machine learning dates back to the year 1963. Donald Michie created a machine consisting of 304 matchboxes and beads, which uses reinforcement learning to play Tic-tac-toe. One of the most popular recent development of machine learning happened in 2016 when Google's AlphaGo program became the first Computer Go program to beat an unhandicapped professional human player using machine learning. 

Besides the big events that shocked the world, machine learning has already taken control of many tasks that were once too complicated for the computers to achieve. YouTube uses machine learning to recognize the patterns of copyrighted content and monetize or remove videos from their service; Facebook uses machine learning to identify user-published content that is against the regulation and automatically remove the posts; Spotify uses machine learning to create a playlist containing songs that you are probably going to love just for you. 

Machine learning has changed our lives, even without us noticing. With more effort put in its research and development and the guidance by the professional developers and ethicists, machine learning has the power and potential to change the world.
