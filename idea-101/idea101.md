# Idea No. 101: Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

The developers do not need to code step-by-step instructions, they only need to "teach" the computers how to complete certain tasks, and the computers would "figure out" the way to do it, shifting the concentration of programming to writing algorithms, the code to "teach" a computer.
